Quotes serve multiple purpose. Sometimes they are like a lighthouse. In the event of darkness, they act as a guiding force. At other times, it's just a means of expressing feelings or emotions. Various famous personalities sum up their experiences in quotations. There are thousand of quotes spanning across different themes. In fact, there are complete books written on quotations. One of them is a book titled    *[The ultimate book of Quotations](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Book-Quotations-Joseph-Demakis/dp/1481053027)* written by Joseph M Demakis. The book is 542 page long and rated 4.2. 

I like quotations as they are short and witty. It gives you a time to reflect without requiring you to be very involved in it. In this article, I've collected a few quotes which I like. Hope you enjoy reading them and feel motivated after you reflect on them.

The first two quotes I've selected is by Hockey player Wayne Gretzky:

> :dart: You miss 100 percent of the shots you never take.

The quote is short yet powerful. It inspires people into action. Often people are overwhelmed by the task even before starting it. The point is yes the task may be hard, but by not even attempting it you are ensuring the failure.


> :golf: I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.

Another masterpiece. There could be multiple interpretations to this quote. Put it simply, it means focus on future instead of worrying on the past. This is not to say that you don't learn from your mistakes in past but to not get bogged down by the past.


The source of the next quote is not known. But that does not diminish it's beauty.

> :trophy: You can have anything you want. However, you can’t have everything you want.

The quote stresses on the importance of focus. With perserverance and focus, you can achieve impossible things. However, if you divert your attention and energy on multiple things, then the problem starts. You may find it rewarding in short run but over long run, as thing starts getting more involved and complex, things start to go out of place.

The last two quotes are one of my biggest learnings while managing products in the Indian Education Space. The first one is by Benjamin Franklin

> :rowboat: Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

This quote captures the importance of different levels of involvement required for learning to take place. Their are different levels to which you can learn a concept or skill. The most basic level is obviously recalling the concept or skill. The highest level being subconciously applying the concept and skill in multiple concepts. Now to achieve that level, you need to be hands-on and get involved. So 'doing' can not be sperated for 'learning' in short.

The second quote is Robert H. Schuller

> :bulb: Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines.

This quote is slightly different in it's outlook towards failures and problems. It goes one step beyond than just suggesting people to embrace the failure. Although embracing the failure is an important step, but it's certainly not the only step. There exists a far more important step and that is to dissect the reason for failure. And improve on it the next time. Trying again and again is not enough, trying again and again in right direction is as much important. For example during a learning journey, the errors should drive the decision to chose learning paths of blindly following predecided path.

Thanks for reading the article till the end. Hope you enjoyed it!
