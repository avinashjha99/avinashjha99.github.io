## A New Post

Product Management is a relatively new field and hence aspiring & budding Product Managers find it difficult to get the information pertinent to Product Management roles in one place. To circumvent this difficulty, I want to write primers which would aim to:
- help aspiring & budding PMs to know what all subject areas are essential.
- give some sneek peak into the PM role based on the experience of practising PMs.
- provide sufficent knowledge about a relevant subject area so that they can explore them further.
- provide a forum to ask their Product Management related questions.

The Product Management primer is divided into 11 parts. These parts cover various areas like Strategy, Marketing, Analytics, Technology, Operations and Finance. Each primer would introduct the area and explain why is it important for a Product Manager and what kind of competency is required on his/her part.

- Part 1. Strategy: Understanding companies vision and focus
- Part 2. Strategy: Understanding market and role of all the stakeholders
- Part 3. Marketing: Gathering customer insights
- Part 4. Marketing: Gathering competion analysis
- Part 5. Analytics: Collecting and analysing big data
- Part 6. Technology: Crafting solutions
- Part 7. Operations: Program and project execution
- Part 8. Operations: Training all the internal stakeholders
- Part 9. Marketing: Market launch strategies
- Part 10. Analytics: Defining and tracking performance
- Part 11. Finance: Appraising product and preparing for next iteration
