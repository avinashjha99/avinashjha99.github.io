## In this article we will dig deeper into common mobile app metrics like ARPU, CLTV, CAC, Engagement, Retention using one real use case.

Mobile app metrics help business teams to gauge at the performance of the apps in more objective way. In this article, I would like to show you how to calculate by taking a live and popular application. 

Many people have a hobby of collecting trump cards and stickers. They collect the cards and stickers and put it in their album collection. The trump cards could be related to a popular tv series like Pokemon, Dragon-ballz or popular sports like Football, Basketball & Cricket & the list goes on. 

The application I have chosen is Panini's FIFA World Cup Trading App. This application is meant for people who love collecting football trump cards and stickers during world cup. Interestingly, Panini is officially licensed by FIFA to produce and sell world cup stickers. Panini also has the offline stickers album.

Download the Panini's FIFA Trading App from [Android link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paninidigitalinc.fifatrader) or [iOS link](https://itunes.apple.com/ae/app/fifa-world-cup-trading-app/id1305849940?mt=8). We would be focusing on the 2018 World Cup Collection.

Now without further ado, let's start the analysis.

The starting point of the analysis is to value the time and money. This may sound simple, but this is the crux of this analysis.

**1) Value all the digital assets in the mobile App**
**2) Estimate time taken to acquire these assets without spending the money**

I did this analysis on this app and came up with the following table:

So value of all the digital assets is estimated to be $ 481.
And a fully engaged, non-paying and loyal customer is expected to stay on the platform for 551 days.  

Now comes our first key number, revenue per user per day. This is $ 0.87.

Now comes a difficult and unpredictable part, which is estimating the churn rate of the acquired user.

Here you should assume, 3 different cases: best case, most likey case, worst case
