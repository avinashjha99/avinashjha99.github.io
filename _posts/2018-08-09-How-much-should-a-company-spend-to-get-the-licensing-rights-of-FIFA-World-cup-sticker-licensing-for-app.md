## In this article we will try to estimate the licensing cost for FIFA world cup sticker usage rights on the app.

Many people have a hobby of collecting trump cards and stickers. They collect the cards and stickers and put it in their album collection. The trump cards could be related to a popular tv series like Pokemon, Dragon-ballz or popular sports like Football, Basketball & Cricket & the list goes on. 

The application which capitalizes on the football sticker collector's hobby is Panini's FIFA World Cup Trading App. This application is meant for people who love collecting football trump cards and stickers during world cup. Panini is officially licensed by FIFA to produce and sell world cup stickers. Panini also has the offline stickers album.

In this article, we will try to estimate the app only licensing costs for FIFA World Cup.

Download the Panini's FIFA Trading App from [Android link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paninidigitalinc.fifatrader) or [iOS link](https://itunes.apple.com/ae/app/fifa-world-cup-trading-app/id1305849940?mt=8). We would be focusing on the 2018 World Cup Collection.

Now without further ado, let's start the analysis.

The starting point of the analysis is to value the time and money. This may sound simple, but this is the crux of this analysis.

**1) Value all the digital assets in the mobile App**
**2) Estimate time taken to acquire these assets without spending the money**

I did this analysis on this app and came up with the following table:

Value of all the digital assets is estimated to be $ 481.
And a fully engaged, non-paying and loyal customer is expected to stay on the platform for 551 days.  

So, revenue from every fully engaged and loyal user = Value of all the digital assets = $ 481
Customer life cycle = 551 days

Now comes our first key number, revenue per user per day. This is $ 0.87.

Now comes a difficult and unpredictable part, which is estimating the churn rate of the acquired user. For this, we would chose, industry benchmark numbers. Industry benchmark numbers are a good starting point if you don't have access to company's internatl data or you are in initial stages and want to do estimates before hand.

Industry benchmark [report](https://www.statista.com/statistics/259329/ios-and-android-app-user-retention-rate/) by Statista gives following two key numbers for games category:
1-day retention = 27.1%
30-day retention = 4.5%

We will use these numbers and assume that the pool of acquired customers leave the platform linearly (or evenly) over the given period of time and the retention is 0 at the end of app life cycle usage.

So based on these, the ARPU would be given by the following formula:

(Revenue for every fully engaged and loyal user) * (Churn factor)

The churn factor = (1/Customer_life_cycle)*(0.5 + 15*1_day_retention + 14.5*30_day_retention + 0.5*(Customer_life_cycle-30)*(30_day_retention)

Note that in the above formula, 1_day_retention & 30_day_retention would be entered in fraction.

So in this case the ARPU = 481 * (1/551*(0.5+ 15*0.271 + 14.5*0.045 + 0.5* (551-30)*0.045)
= $ 481*0.05708
= $ 27.45

So, ARPU is estimated to be $27.45.


ARPU has to cover up for all the costs incurred by the company and then do some earnings.

Customer Acquisition Cost is the amount a company can spend to acquire the customer. 
Assuming 60% operating cost for the company, $ 16.47 is the marginal cost of company to sustain itself. 
Further, assuming company expects 10% return on it's investment, the marginal amount left is 8.235 is So a company can spend anything between $0 to $8.235 to acquire customers. The app has 1M+ customers on the playstore and is acquiring customers at 100K+ customer per month. So estimated number of users is expected to be around $10M.

So a company should can spend approximately $80M for the license of app rights alone of FIFA sticer album.
